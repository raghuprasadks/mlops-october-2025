Todo list
1. Develop end to end ML application
for classification problem. 
UI to access the classification model
Streamlit using python
React
Steps:
1. open VS code
2. Co-pilot prompt
develop a logistic regression model using publicly available dataset
save model into a pickle file.
3.Create a flask api  to predict
4. Create a UI to test this using streamlit
