Agenda:
Recap
1. Introduction to Devops
2. Introduction to MLops
3. Developing sample python flask application
and deployed on Docker/Dockerhub
4. Developed Linear Regression Model,
created API,deployed on docker/dockerhub
5. Deployed using GitHub actions
CI-CD pipe line

Todo list
1. Develop end to end ML application
for classification problem. 
UI to access the classification model
Streamlit using python
React
Steps:
1. open VS code
2. Co-pilot prompt
a. develop a logistic regression model using publicly available dataset
b. test to check the prediction for 1st and 3rd dataset
c. convert model into a pickle file
d. create flask api to predict
e. how to test this using postman
f. create a streamlit application to develop ui for app.py
g. To run  streamlit
streamlit run <programname>


save model into a pickle file.
3.Create a flask api  to predict
4. Create a UI to test this using streamlit
